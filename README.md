Power BI Analysis Project 5Ô∏è‚É£ .

Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard.

This project contain the  historical data set and store the multiple column related Electric Vehicle .

I have complete a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard that delves into Electric Vehicle data, offering actionable insights and visualization to optimize business strategies. this project allowed me to apply advance techniques in data analysis DAX calculation and interactive reporting.

Use the power query editor clean the data we got full insight  so that we can make we create the interactive report and dashboard.

 üîç Project Highlights:

‚úèÔ∏è KPI's Requirement:

1. Total Vehicle:

‚óæUnderstand the overall landscape of electric vehicle          encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs to assess the market's           size and growths.

 2.Average Electric Range:

‚óæ Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs

3. Total BEV Vehicle and % of Total BEV vehicles:

‚óæ Identify and analyze the total umber of Battery Electric Vehicles(BEVs) in the dataset

‚óæ Calculate the percentage the of BEVs  relative of the electric vehicle, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

4. Total PHEV Vehicle and % of total PHEV Vehicle:

‚óæ Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle(PHEVs) in the dataset.

‚óæCalculate the percentage the of PHEVs relative of the electric vehicle providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
